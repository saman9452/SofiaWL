# Replication Package

The overall steps are

1. Install Relational Git
2. Get the Database
3. Run the Simulations
4. Dump the Simulation Data to CSV
5. Calculate the Expertise, Workload, and FaR measures

## Install Relational Git

1) [Install](https://github.com/fahimeh1368/SofiaWL/blob/gh-pages/install.md) the tool and its dependencies.

## Get the Database

1) Restore the backup of the data into MS Sql Server. For each studied project there is a separate database. You can select individual files from the [db backup](https://www.dropbox.com/home/SofiaWL-Data). Note, some files are over 15GB.
2) Copy the [configuration files](config).
3) Open and modify each configuration file to set the connection string. You need to provide the server address along with the credentials. The following snippet shows a sample of how connection string should be set.

```json
 {
	"ConnectionStrings": {
	  "RelationalGit": "Server=ip_db_server;User Id=user_name;Password=pass_word;Database=coreclr"
	},
	"Mining":{
 		
  	}
 }
```

4) Open [simulations.ps1](simulations.ps1) using an editor and make sure the config variables defined at the top of the file are reffering to the correct location of the downloaded config files. 

```powershell
# Each of the following variables contains the absolute path of the corresponding configuation file.
$corefx_conf = "absolute/path/to/corefx_conf.json"
$coreclr_conf = "absolute/path/to/coreclr_conf.json"
$roslyn_conf = "absolute/path/to/roslyn_conf.json"
$rust_conf = "absolute/path/to/rust_conf.json"
$kubernetes_conf = "absolute/path/to/kubernetes_conf.json"
```

## Run the Simulations

1) Run the [simulations.ps1](simulations.ps1) script. Open PowerShell and run the following command in the directory of the file

``` powershell
./simulations.ps1
```

This script runs all the defined reviewer recommendation algorithms across all projects. Each run is called a simulation because for each pull request, one of the actual reviewers is randomly selected to be replaced by the top recommended reviewer.

**Note**: Make sure you have set the PowerShell [execution policy](https://superuser.com/questions/106360/how-to-enable-execution-of-powershell-scripts) to **Unrestricted** or **RemoteAssigned**.

**Note**: For performance comparision purposes we only choose reviewers to be replaced randomly for chRev. for the other algorithms, we use the same reviewers to remove the randomness of results. The way to do this is by choosing **"Random"** value for the command when running simulations for chRev and **"SeededRandom"** value for all the other algorithms.

## Research Questions

In the following sections, we show which simulations are used for which research questions. For each simulation, a sample is provided that illustrates how the simulation can be run using the tool.

### Empirical RQ1, Review and Turnover: What is the reduction in files at risk to turnover when both authors and reviewers are considered knowledgeable?


```PowerShell
# committers only
dotnet-rgit --cmd simulate-recommender --recommendation-strategy NoReviews --conf-path <path_to_config_file>
# committers + reviewers = what happened in "Reality"
dotnet-rgit --cmd simulate-recommender --recommendation-strategy Reality --conf-path <path_to_config_file>
```

Log into the database and run

```SQL
-- Get the Id of the simulation 
select Id, KnowledgeShareStrategyType, StartDateTime from LossSimulations
```

Using the Id returned from above, compare the knowledge loss with and without considering reviewers knowledgable run the following: 

```PowerShell
dotnet-rgit --cmd analyze-simulations --analyze-result-path "path_to_result" --no-reviews-simulation <no_reviews_sim_id> --reality-simulation <reality_sim_id>  --conf-path <path_to_config_file>
```
In order to get Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), log into the database and run

```SQL
-- Get MRR using the Id of the simulation
select AVG([MeanReciprocalRank])
  from PullRequestRecommendationResults where LossSimulationId = Id
```
---

### Simulation RQ2, Ownership Aware: Does recommending reviewers based on code and review file ownership reduce the number of files at risk to turnover?

```PowerShell
# AuthorshipRec Recommender
dotnet-rgit --cmd simulate-recommender --recommendation-strategy AuthorshipRec --simulation-type "SeededRandom" --conf-path <path_to_config_file>
# RevOwnRec Recommender
dotnet-rgit --cmd simulate-recommender --recommendation-strategy RecOwnRec  --simulation-type "SeededRandom" --conf-path <path_to_config_file>
# cHRev Recommender
dotnet-rgit --cmd simulate-recommender --recommendation-strategy cHRev  --simulation-type "Random" --conf-path <path_to_config_file>
```

---

### Simulation RQ3, Turnover Aware: Can we reduce the number of files at risk to turnover by developing learning and retention aware review recommenders?

```PowerShell
# LearnRec Recommender
dotnet-rgit --cmd simulate-recommender --recommendation-strategy LearnRec --simulation-type "SeededRandom" --conf-path <path_to_config_file>
# RetentionRec Recommender
dotnet-rgit --cmd simulate-recommender --recommendation-strategy RetentionRec --simulation-type "SeededRandom"  --conf-path <path_to_config_file>
# TurnoverRec Recommender
dotnet-rgit --cmd simulate-recommender --recommendation-strategy TurnoverRec --simulation-type "SeededRandom" --conf-path <path_to_config_file>
# Sofia Recommender
dotnet-rgit --cmd simulate-recommender --recommendation-strategy sofia --simulation-type "SeededRandom" --conf-path <path_to_config_file>
```

---

### Empirical RQ4, Review Workload: How is the review workload distributed across developers?

```PowerShell
# Get each developer's number of open reviews in "day", "week", "month", "quarter", "year"
dotnet-rgit --cmd  get-workload --analyze-type <analyze-type> --analyze-result-path "path_to_result"  --reality-simulation <reality_id>  --conf-path <path_to_config_file>
```

To calculate the Gini of the actual review workload run [ActualWorkload.r](WorkloadMeasures/ActualWorkload.R). The data from the paper is available in [CSV](ResultsCSV/WorkloadAUC/Actual/) format.

### Simulation RQ5, Workload Aware: WhoDo is designed to be workload aware, but can it also balance Expertise, Workload, and FarR

```PowerShell
#WhoDo recommender
dotnet-rgit --cmd simulate-recommender --recommendation-strategy WhoDo --simulation-type "SeededRandom" --conf-path <path_to_config_file>

```
---

### Simulation RQ6: Ownership, Turnover, and Workload Aware: Can we combine the recommenders to balance Expertise, Workload, and FaR?

```PowerShell
#SofiaWL recommender
dotnet-rgit --cmd simulate-recommender --recommendation-strategy SofiaWL --simulation-type "SeededRandom"  --conf-path <path_to_config_file>
```
---

## Dump the Simulation Data to CSV

Log into the database and run

```SQL
-- Get the Id of the simulation 
select Id, KnowledgeShareStrategyType, StartDateTime from LossSimulations
```

Substitute the Id returned above for the recommender \<rec_sim_id\> and compare the recommenders with the actual values, \<reality_id>.

before running the following command, modify relationalgit.json file and set the Database value in "ConnectionStrings" to the database name. If this step is skiped, the **auc.csv** will be created but it will be empty.

```PowerShell
dotnet-rgit --cmd analyze-simulations --analyze-result-path "path_to_result" --recommender-simulation <rec_sim_id> --reality-simulation <reality_id>  --conf-path <path_to_config_file>
```

### Expertise and FAR results, and prior (ICSE) Workload measure results

The tool creates four csv files, **expertise.csv**, **far.csv**, **workload.csv** and **auc.csv**  respectively. In the first three files, the first column shows the project's periods (quarters). Each column corresponds to one of the simulations. Each cell shows the percentage change between the actual outcome and the simulated outcome in that period. The last row of a column shows the median of its values. Note the **workload.csv** file is the prior workload measure used in the original ICSE version of the paper. The following table illustrates how a csv file of a project with 5 periods is formatted, assuming that only cHRev, TurnoverRec, and Sofia got compared with reality. For completeness we also show the top ten workload with the new outcomes [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CXXAPims3Zjs5zeDnFH80Gz3sq_GmYOYVpGt3p0oIP4/edit?usp=sharing)

| Periods       | cHRev         | cHRev         | TurnoverRec   | Sofia         |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |-------------- |
| 1  | 9.12  | 20 | 15  | 10  |
| 2  | 45.87  | 30  | 20  | 25  |
| 3  | 25.10  | 40  | 25  | 42  |
| 4  | 32.10  | 50  | 30  | 90  |
| 5  | 10.10  | 60  | 35  | 34.78  |
| Median  | 25.10  | 40  | 25  | 25  |

**Note**: During simulations, for each pull request, one reviewer is randomly selected to be replaced by the top recommended reviewer. 

### Gini AUC CDF of Review Workload 

The file **auc.csv** from the prior step, shows the number of reviews of developers in each quarter. To calculate the Gini AUC-based Workload measure run [WorkloadAUC.r](WorkloadMeasures/WorkloadAUC.R). The data from our simulations are in [CSV](ResultsCSV/WorkloadAUC/Simulated/).

### Exponential weighting for RetetionRec 
We changed Contribution of developers from Yearly to the weighted one and value recent contribution more and the code for this part is in [commit](https://github.com/fahimeh1368/SofiaWL/commit/f452397e939eeb88dc3bbc7007115a190e004eb8) but the results was not as good as RetentionRec which is shown below.

|Project         | Expertise       | FaR         | Gini        |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |-------------|
| CoreFX  | 12.93  | -24.25 | 9  |
| CoreCLR  | 10.78  | -12.88  | 16.57  |
| Roslyn | 14.70  |-17.94  | 11.63  | 
| Rust  | 12.68  | -4.73  | 11.5  | 90  |
| Kubernetes  | 19.68  | -16.43  | 9.72  |
| Average  | 14.15  | -15.24  | 11.78  |


### Sensitivity analysis for k in SofiaV2
We change the line of the config file manually which is "RecommenderOption": "alpha-1,beta-1,risk-3,hoarder_ratio-1", To change k for Risky files. In this line risk-number shows the k+1. It means that if we have risk-3 files that have less than 2 developer are considered risky. The results of sensitive analysis exists in [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CXXAPims3Zjs5zeDnFH80Gz3sq_GmYOYVpGt3p0oIP4/edit#gid=1577563518)
